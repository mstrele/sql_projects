## Analyze Twitch Gaming Data

Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with 15 million daily active users. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the main responsibilities of the Twitch Science Team.

This project includes two tables that contain Twitch users’ stream viewing data and chat room usage data.

**Stream viewing data:**
- *stream* table

**Chat usage data:**
- *chat* table

twitch_gaming_data.sql contains *sqlite* code that gets us the data needed.
